Firmware for breathere emergency pandemic ventilator https://www.breathere.ca/

The BreatHere firmware operates on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE available in large quantities in worldwide distributors. It acquires data from a sensirion SFM3300-D or SFM3300-AW flow sensor, and forwards it to the user interface using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). 
The firmware is available to the open source community on a github repository (https://github.com/lemwill/breathere-firmware). To flash the firmware:
1.	Download the source code from the github repository
2.	Download and install the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
3.	Connect the Arduino Nano 33 BLE to the computer using a micro-USB cable
4.	Flash the breathere-firmware.ino file to the Arduino (Figure 3).
